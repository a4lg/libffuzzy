libffuzzy : Fast ssdeep comparison library
===========================================

libffuzzy is fuzzy hashing comparison library compatible with
ssdeep (<http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net/>) version 2.10.

This library is designed to be fast and thread-safe. It does not even
allocate memory dynamically during the process (which may increase
performance on parallel computation).

The another purpose to write this library is to find implementation
issues in ssdeep. During this re-implementation, the author found
several issues which may affect robustness and portability in ssdeep.


Functions
----------

Global functions are named like ffuzzy_SOMETHING.
You can use ffuzzy_compare function just like fuzzy_compare.
